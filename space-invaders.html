<h1>Space Invaders</h1>

<p>This was a fun and quick project. As I was continuing to explore Python, I wanted to see if it was possible to make a game. Spoiler alert : it was. 
    I learned all about the pygame library which is great for those that want to create 2D games. Using that library, I was able to make a game of Space Invaders, that is fully functioning. 
    I could have gone deeper with it and created harder challenges, different modes, etc., but I achieved what I had set out to do with this project.</p>
