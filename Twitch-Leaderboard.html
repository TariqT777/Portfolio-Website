    <p>I absolutely love this project. It was my hardest one, but it was oh so rewarding. I wanted a way to display a Twitch livestreamer's current top chatters on a webpage. 
        The idea for this project came about when I realized that no webpage like that existed (at least not one that I was able to find). So I got to work.

    <p>The difficulty quickly made itself known when I realized how much I had to learn about to make this project a reality. I knew Python, but new very little about websockets (which I needed to make this project work in real-time) or HTTP requests.
        I had to learn Flask, and learned some things about BootStrap. All of this learning took some time, but as I continually moved forward, I saw progress. Until the blessed moment when I saw the results display to the screen.
        Overall fun and challenging project, and I am so happy that I did it.
