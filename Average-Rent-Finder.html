    <p>I speak for most recent graduates when I say that looking for an apartment is hard. One of the hardest parts about it is finding a good area, where the prices aren't too steep.
        In comes the Average Rent Finder to save the day! It can take any city (in North America), and give a *rough* estimate on what the average rent is in that area, just to help that search out a bit. </p>
