    <p>This is one of my most recent projects. I used to play a decent amount of video games, and one thing that would entail : A gamertag(Username online). 
        There have been multiple times that I would use a name generator to create a new gamertag for a new game or service I was using, so I figured, "why use what I normally do, but make it for any type of account?".
        Here, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript and grabbed data from 2 separate API's, which is something I have struggled with doing for a while. Thankfully I was able to do it, and this is the final result!
