            About Tariq
        </h1>
        <h2>
            Who am I?
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am a recent graduate of Howard University, with a B.S. in Computer Science. I am originally from Atlanta, GA, but I currently reside in the Washington D.C. area.
        </p>

        <h2>
            What are my passions?
        </h2>
        <p>
            I love self improvement first and foremost. I find meaning in always learning, growing and improving. That doesn't mean it's easy, but it's always worth it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Besides self improvement, I enjoy sports (basketball and skateboarding especially), friends, and investing! I am currently invested in the stock market and I'm constantly adding to my investment portfolio. I hope to invest in real estate when the time is right.
        </p>
