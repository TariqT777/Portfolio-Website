    <p>This project is probably in the top two of my most difficult projects to do.</p>

    <p>Why you ask?</p>

    <p>Well only for the fact that this was during Spring semester of the lovely year that was 2020. 3 teammates and I, while in Silicon Valley for a domestic exchange program with Google were tasked with creating a webpp.
        We were free to basically choose what we wanted to do. So we created this music game. The problem is, we were working with softwares that we were completely unfamiliar with.
        On top of that, during the middle of the semester we all had to go back to our respective homes due to Covid-19. So we were then operating off of different time zones. 
        There were a lot of complications throughout the semester, but we got the work done, and I am proud of it.
