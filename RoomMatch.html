    <h3>*P.S.* If we seemed tired here, it's because we were haha! We did this right in the midst of finals, so there probably was a collective 6 hours of sleep between all 4 of us in the few days leading up to that video *sigh*!</h3>

    <p> Ah senior year of college. Which of course means senior project. I teamed up with 3 fellow Senior students to accomplish this project, and the idea really is one that I would enjoy fleshing out.
        We collaborated to come up with the idea of 'RoomMatch' (fun name right?), which is an app that allows students that are interning in the same city to find each other.
        This would allow the process of having a roommate for the summer to be fun, and would allow students to feel safe where they're living. 
        Think of it as a dating app, but for students trying to find a non-crazy roommate instead of love.
